# UAS
Computer Vision application for Drones - IMechE

This repo contains material for iMechE UAS Object Recognition Challenge. 
The task is to recognize ground targets consisting of alphanumeric characters from a drone and provide accurate GPS coordinates.
Uptil now I am only able to classify ground targets as "Targets" and "No Targets". (Binary Classification)

Requirements:
1. Keras with Tensorflow backend.
2. Sci-Kit learn.
3. OpenCV.
4. Pillow
5. h5py
6. Pickle


I am using ConvNet with LeNet inspired architecture.
